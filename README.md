## Description
Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Artificial Intelligence is a review essay I wrote alongside another student for one of our courses at Alzahra University. In this essay, I have read relavent papares, which are available at the reference section, summarized them, and gathered them in one final paper.
In this project, I learned about Medical Image Analysis, previouse Machine Learning methods such as SVM and finally newer methods using Deep Learning.

Here is the abstract:

In this article, we explain the importance of early detection Alzheimer's disease and the reason why we should use AI for that. After that, we discuss a little about the past research in this area with machine learning. Moreover, we introduce Deep learning methods such as image processing and signal processing.
